# Official MelonJS Platformer Tutorial, Retrofitted to the es6-boilerplate package

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/melonjs/es6-boilerplate/blob/master/LICENSE)

This project takes the completed source code from [tutorial-platformer](https://github.com/melonjs/tutorial-platformer) and 
makes it compatible with the es6 template provided by MelonJS.

Please Note: This package is not the complete tutorial, with all the steps and documentation of how to get to the end result.
Instead, this package *is* the end result, showing how the completed game would be written in es6 using the boilerplate 
as a starting point.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Usage

- `npm run dev` to start the dev server on watch mode at `localhost:9000`.
- `npm run build` to generate a minified, production-ready build, in the `public` folder
